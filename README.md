# Culture FitT Desktop

Culture FitT was an online tweet analyzying tool to help recruiters see if a prospective employee fits into the culture of the company that I helped build at  MLH Prime.
The backend was built in Node.js. The analysis was done with R and various npm packages. 

This is a desktop version of this. I'm using Electron to have it run as a desktop app in windows, Mac, and Linux. I'm rewriting the front end in React. I no longer have a need for the sever because all of the anlaysis can be done locally. I plan to clean up a lot of the sloppy code written in the sleep-deprived hours of MLH Prime.
